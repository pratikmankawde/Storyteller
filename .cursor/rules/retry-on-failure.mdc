# Retry Behavior on Failures

## Retry Policy

When any operation fails (build, install, test, tool calls, etc.), follow this retry strategy:

1. **Wait 10 seconds** before retrying
2. **Retry up to 10 times** before giving up
3. After each failure, wait the full 10 seconds before attempting again
4. If all 10 retries fail, then report the persistent error

## Examples

- Build failures: Wait 10 seconds, retry build command (up to 10 times)
- Installation failures: Wait 10 seconds, retry installation (up to 10 times)
- Test failures: Wait 10 seconds, retry test execution (up to 10 times)
- Tool call failures: Wait 10 seconds, retry the tool call (up to 10 times)

## Implementation

When encountering a failure:
1. Log the failure
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Retry the operation
4. Repeat until success or 10 attempts are exhausted
5. Only report failure after all retries are exhausted
