TEXT:
Welcome to Aurelia-Prime, a world where the laws of physics are more like polite suggestions 
and the "local wildlife" belongs on the side of a 1970s rock van. 
Here is the tale of the crew of the Stardust Rambler. 
 
The Cast of Characters 
1. Jax: The Cocky Captain 
 Role: Pilot and self-appointed "Leader." 
 Vibe: Overconfident, adventurous, and slightly rugged. He sounds like someone who 
has talked his way out of more trouble than hes fought his way out of. 
 TTS Voice Traits: * Pitch: Medium-Low. 
 Pacing: Dynamiche speeds up when hes excited and slows down for 
"dramatic" effect. 
 Tone: Smirking and energetic. Look for a voice that sounds gravelly but 
charismatic. 
 Key Instruction: Add a "swagger" to the delivery; he should sound like hes 
perpetually leaning against a doorway. 
2. Lyra: The Wide-Eyed Xenobiologist 
 Role: Scientist and "Creature Whisperer." 
 Vibe: Infectious curiosity and boundless empathy. She finds a giant spider "adorable" 
rather than terrifying. 
 TTS Voice Traits: * Pitch: Medium-High. 
 Pacing: Moderate to fast. She tends to ramble when talking about alien biology. 
 Tone: Bright, breathless with wonder, and warm. 
 Key Instruction: High inflection at the end of sentences, as if shes constantly 
discovering something new. 
3. Kael: The Stoic Cyborg 
 Role: Security Officer and Tactical Specialist. 
 Vibe: A blend of military precision and dry, deadpan humor. He is the grounded "straight 
man" to the rest of the chaotic crew. 
 TTS Voice Traits: * Pitch: Deep and resonant. 
 Pacing: Slow, rhythmic, and deliberate. He never rushes his words. 
 Tone: Monotone but rich. There should be a subtle "metallic" weight to the 
voice without sounding like a robot. 
 Key Instruction: Very little emotional fluctuation. His humor comes from how flat 
his delivery is. 
4. Zane: The Caffeinated Engineer 
 Role: Lead Mechanic and Resident Panic-Attacker. 
 Vibe: High-strung and brilliant. Hes always three seconds away from a breakdown or a 
breakth
