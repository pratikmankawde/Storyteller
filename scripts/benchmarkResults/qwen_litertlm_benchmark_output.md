=== PASS 2: Character:Dialog mapping ===

**Chapter 1: The Descent into Neon Madness**

The Stardust Rambler didn't land on Aurelia-Prime so much as it aggressively introduced itself to the soil. As the smoke cleared, Jax kicked the manual override on the hatch. "See? I told you the landing gear was optional."

"We’re missing a wing, Jax," Zane whimpered, clutching a diagnostic tablet like a holy relic. They stepped out into a forest of Obsidian Ferns that hummed in B-flat. Above them, two suns—one violet, one amber—cast long, surreal shadows. Their mission was simple: find the Aether-Pulse, a mythical power source hidden in the Floating Spires of Zephyr, to refuel their ship before the planet's nocturnal "Shadow-Stalkers" woke up.

"Movement at twelve o'clock," Kael rumbled, his bionic eye whirring. Out of the brush stepped Mina, her skin glowing a soft cyan. She didn't use a weapon; she carried a staff made of living coral.

"You seek the Pulse," she said, her voice echoing as if underwater. "But the path is guarded by the Crystalline Hydra. If you want to live, follow the silence, not the light."

**Chapter 2: The Hydra’s Riddle**

The trek through the Whispering Jungles was a test of nerves. Lyra was distracted every five minutes, trying to pet Echo-Foxes—creatures that could mimic a person's deepest secrets. "Don't listen to it, Zane!" Lyra laughed as a fox chirped in Zane’s own voice about his secret fear of space-toasters.

Suddenly, the ground shook. They reached the Chasm of Glass, where the Hydra waited. It wasn't a beast of flesh, but of translucent quartz, its three heads refracting the sunlight into blinding lasers.

"Standard protocol?" Kael asked, his arm transforming into a kinetic shield.

"Standard protocol," Jax smirked. "Zane, cause a distraction. Lyra, find its weak spot. Kael, try not to get shattered."

The battle was a chaotic dance. The Hydra fired beams of concentrated violet light that turned the ground to magma. Zane threw "glitter-bombs"—conductive dust that scrambled the Hydra's internal resonance—while Lyra noticed the beast's heads pulsed in rhythm with the wind.

"It’s not attacking!" Lyra shouted over the roar. "It’s harmonizing! We’re out of tune!"

Taking the hint, Jax grabbed a discarded metal plate and began drumming a counter-rhythm. The Hydra paused, its crystalline scales dimming from an angry red to a calm azure. It lowered its heads, allowing them to pass over the bridge of its own back.

**Chapter 3: The Ascent of the Void-Griffin**

The final stretch took them to the Floating Spires, islands of rock held aloft by the planet's massive magnetic core. To reach the Aether-Pulse at the summit, they had to bypass the Void-Griffin, a creature of literal starlight and shadow.

As they climbed the gravity-defying stairs, the air grew thin. The Griffin descended, its wings spanning thirty feet, shedding feathers of pure dark matter. It didn't attack; it simply stood between them and the glowing orb of the Pulse.

"It requires a trade," Mina whispered. "The Griffin doesn't want gold. It wants a memory."

Character: "Something heavy enough to ground it to this world."

SPEAKER ATTRIBUTION RULES: QUOTED SPEECH
Character: "Let's get out of here," Jax said, his voice unusually soft. "I think the Rambler has had enough adventure for one day."
