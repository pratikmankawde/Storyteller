TEXT:
Welcome to Aurelia-Prime, a world where the laws of physics are more like polite suggestions 
and the "local wildlife" belongs on the side of a 1970s rock van. 
Here is the tale of the crew of the Stardust Rambler. 
 
The Cast of Characters 
1. Jax: The Cocky Captain 
●​ Role: Pilot and self-appointed "Leader." 
●​ Vibe: Overconfident, adventurous, and slightly rugged. He sounds like someone who 
has talked his way out of more trouble than he’s fought his way out of. 
●​ TTS Voice Traits: * Pitch: Medium-Low. 
○​ Pacing: Dynamic—he speeds up when he’s excited and slows down for 
"dramatic" effect. 
○​ Tone: Smirking and energetic. Look for a voice that sounds gravelly but 
charismatic. 
○​ Key Instruction: Add a "swagger" to the delivery; he should sound like he’s 
perpetually leaning against a doorway. 
2. Lyra: The Wide-Eyed Xenobiologist 
●​ Role: Scientist and "Creature Whisperer." 
●​ Vibe: Infectious curiosity and boundless empathy. She finds a giant spider "adorable" 
rather than terrifying. 
●​ TTS Voice Traits: * Pitch: Medium-High. 
○​ Pacing: Moderate to fast. She tends to ramble when talking about alien biology. 
○​ Tone: Bright, breathless with wonder, and warm. 
○​ Key Instruction: High inflection at the end of sentences, as if she’s constantly 
discovering something new. 
3. Kael: The Stoic Cyborg 
●​ Role: Security Officer and Tactical Specialist. 
●​ Vibe: A blend of military precision and dry, deadpan humor. He is the grounded "straight 
man" to the rest of <|im_end|>
